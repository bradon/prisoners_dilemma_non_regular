prisoners_dilemma_non_regular
=============================
Public code release
Simulated Evolution of Non-Regular Strategies for the Prisoner's Dilemma

This branch will contain my code as of the 14th November 2014, in an archive importable into eclipse (and probably other IDEs).

You will need to add the following dependencies yourself:
guava 13.0.1
jcommander 1.30

You will also need to add:
https://github.com/juliangarcia/agentbased
https://github.com/juliangarcia/jevodyn
https://github.com/juliangarcia/repeated_games

In the future maven will handle all of this (and this branch will not be useful)
